[![Test and release](https://github.com/hubra-app/hubra-plugin-budgets/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hubra-app/hubra-plugin-budgets/actions/workflows/release.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hubra-app/hubra-plugin-budgets)](https://github.com/hubra-app/hubra-plugin-budgets/releases/latest) [![License: all rights reserved](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-all%20rights%20reserved-lightgrey)](LICENSE)

A plugin for [Hubra](https://hubra.club). A yearly budget per transaction category, compared with what was booked. Approve and lock it, and copy it to the next year.

**Version** 1.0.0 · **Works with** Hubra >=0.1,<1 · **Plugin id** `budgets`

## Install

Platform admins install it from the plugin catalogue in the manager portal
(official Marketplace, <https://plugins.hubra.club/index.json>, signed with
the Hubra project key). Clubs then switch it on under Einstellungen → Module
& Plugins.

## Develop

Clone this repository into `plugins/budgets` of a Hubra checkout. Its tests
then run with Hubra's (`cd app/backend && pytest ../../plugins/budgets`), and
`npm run build:plugin` in `app/frontend` builds its frontend. The workflow
does the same against Hubra's `main` on every push and pull request.

## Releasing

Bump `version` in `plugin.yaml`, add a `## <version>` section to
`CHANGELOG.md` and merge. Then tag the merged commit on main and push the tag:

```sh
git switch main && git pull
git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>
```

The workflow tests the plugin and builds its frontend, the `plugin-signing`
job signs it after your approval, and only then is the GitHub release
`v<version>` published, with `budgets-<version>.zip` and its `.sha256` attached. Files
listed in `.releaseignore` stay out of the zip. Releases are immutable, so a
published version never changes: fix a bad one with a new version.
